<subtitle>Hello World

<p(img=dennis.png)>There is a tradition among programmers that the FIRST program you write in any new language prints out the words “Hello World”. This dates back to the legendary programmer Dennis Ritchie, arguably the father of modern computing.

<p>You will run a small JavaScript program to print “Hello World” right on this page.  That’s the magic of JavaScript. But to see the result you must first open up the developer’s console that is already built into your browser.

<p>To open the Console on Windows, Linux, or a Chromebook, press Control+Shift+J. On a Mac, press Command+Option+J. Try it now, make sure it works.

<p>The image on the right is what you should see using Chrome.  It will be slightly different in Firefox and Microsoft Edge. If you are using another browser, then download Chrome from [<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">https://www.google.com/chrome</a>|w w w dot google dot com] and try again.  If you have trouble, stop and get help.  You should not go on until you have a console open.

<p>Now click on the small piece of code below [`console.log(“Hello World”)` | console dot log Hello World]. Press CTRL+ENTER to run this program, and you should see a result in the console.  Try it now.  Did you see “Hello World” typed in the console?

<cm>
console.log(“Hello World”)

<p>`console.log()` is a function that prints the value between the two brackets. You will use it to peek into your programs.  “Hello World” is an ordinary one-line JavaScript program, there is nothing special about it.

<subtitle>Numbers
<p>The simplest type of _value_ is _Number_  which are just numbers.
<p>We use _Number_s for counting, and sometimes for arithmetic. We can add, subtract, multiply and divide number values and produce a new number value. In a JavaScript program, numbers are written like this:
<pre>
13
9.81

<p>Try running, and then modifying this little program.
<cm>
console.log(2 + 2)

<p>Can you calculate the value of 2 + 2 + 2?  Please try each of the little programs as you proceed through this lesson.  Modify them, play with them.
