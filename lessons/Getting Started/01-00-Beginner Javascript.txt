<title>Welcome to GameCode
<p>Everyone dreams of writing video games. It's a great hobby, and maybe even a career.
<p>There is a lot to learn.  And there are many great courses to help you learn.  This one is a bit different.  We are going to teach you high school math and physics, except you won't notice because we are teaching also you how to write video games.
<break>

<p>Games needs almost all the math you learn in high school.  Computer graphics need functions, vectors, matrices, trigonometry, and more.  Making a game's movements look realistic needs physics, and that means some calculus.
<p>Game design adds another layer. Game design requires many of the disciplines of system engineering, such as probability, communications, and feedback.  We'll get you started on these ideas.
<p>And of course we are going to have to teach you programming, how to use the real-world tools you need like compilers and editors.

Or you can download Unity and start trying to figure it out. <break>
<p>Here's the thing. Writing games need almost all the math and physics you learn in high-school. And writing a serious game takes serious programming skills.  There's no shortcut.  
<break>
<p> So we wrote a programming course that teaches you math, physics, and programming.  It will cover most of the math and physics you need for grade 10 and 11. It will teach serious programming. And it will how to use the

<p>The language we will teach you is called JavaScript.  It is the most popular language in 

<p(img=scratch.png)>We assume you don't know anything about programming, but we aren't going to use a beginner coding language like [<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted">Scratch</a>|scratch] or [<a href="https://www.alice.org/resources/alice-3-how-tos/">Alice</a>|Alice].  They use drag-and-drop to make it easy and quick to cobble together things that look like games.  
<p>But it won't be as much fun as you think. You'll get the lessons working, but you will quickly run into limits of the training wheels.

If you are using another browser, then download Chrome from [<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">https://www.google.com/chrome</a>|w w w dot google dot com] and try again.  If you have trouble, stop and get help.  You should not go on until you have a console open.

<p>Welcome.  This is the first lesson, the first step on a long but wonderful journey.

<p>We start every lesson by telling you what we hope you will learn. It is good to check back and ask yourself what you have actually learned, and we're going to help you do that.

<p>This lesson will tell you about a computer language that we are going to use, called 'JavaScript'.  We are going to look at the basic types of data that we can handle, and then write some simple programs.

<p(science)>Hi. I'm Science.  I'm going to pop up and tell you about the history of computing. The reason we do things in certain ways is often because of the path we took.

<p(science)>Here's a fun example - did you ever wonder why your keyboard is so
confused and hard to use, why the keys aren't just A-B-C-D? It's because the earliest mechanical typewriters were very slow, and would jam if the operator went too fast.  So the designers intentionally designed the keyboard to slow down the operators. Here's more information.

<break>
<p(history)>Hi. I'm History.  New stuff has been added to JavaScript continuously, but none of the old stuff has ever been removed.  So much of the language is like a decrepit old amusement park.

<p(history)>I'm hoping you will continue programming JavaScript, but as you look at resorces on the web, you will not understand what you are seeing.

<p(mindset)>Hi. I'm Mindset.
<break>

<p>All _values_ are made of the same kinds of bits, but they don't all behave the same.  Every _value_ has a _type_ that determines its role.  Some values are numbers, some are letters, and some are instructions.   Values are the building blocks of Javascript programs.

<p>This chapter introduces two simple value types _Number_ and _Boolean_, and some operators you can use with them.


<subtitle>Numbers


<p>The simplest type is _Number_  which are just numbers. In a JavaScript program, they are written like this:

<code(noedit)>
13
9.81

<p>We use _Number_s for counting, and sometimes for arithmetic. We can add, subtract, multiply and divide number values and produce a new number value.

<p>But first we're going to show you a neat trick.  You can run a small Javascript program right on this page.  Click on the `console.log( 2 + 2 )` below, and it will turn into a program.  Press CTRL+ENTER to run the program.  Try it now.

<code(vt52)>
console.log(2 + 2)
function a(b){
    return(b+5)
}
<p>`console.log( )` is a function that prints the value between the two brackets.  Please try each of these little programs.  Try modifying them.  Can you calculate the value of 2 + 2 + 2?
