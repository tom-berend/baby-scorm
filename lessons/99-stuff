Our goal at the end of this course is for you to be comfortable using tools like the awesome 
[BabylonJS| Babylon J S|https://www.babylonjs.com] rendering engine.  Check it out!

<p>Check out this example in the [BabylonJS Playground|Babylon J S | https://playground.babylonjs.com/#609QKP#7]. (Drag your mouse to move the camera, WASD to steer.)  Every bit of the code is there, but the learning curve is steep.  Here is the author [asking for help|asking for help|https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/real-physics-enabled-racing-game/4034].
<p>We'll get you there, but in small steps.
